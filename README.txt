Naive Bayes classifier model. Accuracy should be around 80%.

WHAT I WORKED ON:

naive_bayes_solution.py: Class implementing the NB classifier.

Check 'paths for commandline.txt' for commandline arguments into naive_bayes_classifier.py and accuracy_checker.py. Note, these will need to change if you want to use the test files.
Remember to bring the files in files_for_testing to the same folder before running the the test files.


OTHER FILES:

20news-18828: contains the training instances for the NB classifier


dev-set: contains 2000 development files on which accuracy can be checked during development

dev_keys.txt: file containing the true labels for all dev files

test_keys.txt: file containing the true labels for test files

accuracy_checker.py: script to compare output with dev_keys.txt.  DO NOT TOUCH!
naive_bayes_classifier: allows to run the NB classifier trough the commandline. DO NOT TOUCH!
