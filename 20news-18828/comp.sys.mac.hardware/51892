Subject: Mac & IBM Info-Version 1.7.7

{Send follow ups to comp.sys.mac.advocacy. Sorry about the header but the 
Pnews here does not let one easily change the headers and I gave up after a 
year of trying. This sheet is also available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu 
(36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare177.txt.}
Mac & IBM Info-Version 1.7.7

The reason for this general data sheet is to consolidate and condense the 
information out there, so that people in both camps can be clear and accurate 
about what they are saying about their machines.  Since computer technology 
is always changing there are always going to be points in which the sheet will 
be lacking or incorrect on information.  So, please just don't say the sheet 
is incomplete or incorrect but also give me clear and concise information to 
make the needed corrections.  All prices are in US dollars.
To keep this data sheet organized please provide, if possible, article 
citations for the information provided or corrected and keep the opinions to 
a minimum.  As this is a general data sheet, keep the info provided simple so 
I can understand what is being talked about and can explain it to others. 
Finally, keep the information relevant to the section corrected {For example, 
OS code in ROM is software contained in hardware, so no more of the 'but it 
is supported in OS disk software' data for the hardware section, please}. 
Thank you.
Note:  for proper reading off line this document should be in 9 point Monaco.

The CPUs
 Note: I am only showing Motorola & Intel CPUs used in Mac and most IBM/PC 
clone machines. For example, since Apple never used the Motorola 68008 and 
68010 in the Mac these chips are not listed. Years only appear with dead CPUs 
and indicate first to last year used as a CPU.
Cache note:  both IBM and Mac use caches external to the CPUs. These external 
caches increase the speed of the CPU but are not a part of it.  In most of 
the present Macs there are external caches built-in while with IBM they are 
optional {Though machines are generally sold with them installed}.  Since 
there are many different external caches {CPU-Mac and IBM; SCSI, video, disk 
and static RAM-Mac}, each having a different effect on CPU performance, and 
they are machine {32KB static RAM cache in IIci, IIfx, and IIvx}, seller 
{cache card installed in some IIcis} or expansion {IIci cache cards go up to 
128KB} dependent, I have decided to leave them out of the list.
Note:  ALU is industry's de-facto standard for CPU bit classification.

**68000 Mac designs created a 4MB limit.
***The 040 has 2 clocks, an internal processor clock [PCLK] that is 2x freq of 
external bus clock [BCLK] which is the one used to rate the chips 
(Bradley Lamont; Motorola 68040 data book).  Some compilers produce programs 
sensitive to the PCLK and so they act as if the 68040 was a clock doubler 
chip, but this very compiler and program dependent.  Compliers maybe written 
to allow programs to take consitant advantage of the 68040's PCLK in the 
future.  As it is now, studies such as one in a Byte article {which showed 
040/25 ~486/50 and roughly ~486dx2/50} are very dependent on the machine, OS, 
and programs tested and as such are not representative of general performance.
*#Motorola claims (PC Week 09/07/92; 09/14/92).

As the PowerPCs are to be in both IBM and Mac machines I have listed them 
separately to eliminate redundancy.  They are Motorola CPU RISC chips.

CPUs Comparison List
As a general rule of thumb Motorola chips are faster than Intel chips at the 
same frequency {030/25 ~= 386/33; 040/25 ~= 486dx/50}, but Intel has chips at 
higher frequencies than Motorola, so this evens out.  The Macintosh Bible 4th 
ed. supports the comparisons between Intel and Motorola chips for the 68020 
and above.

<=80186    ~ 68000 {16-bit vs 16/24/32-bit chip [data path/address 
lines/data & address registers].  The 4MB limit on the 68000 Macs brings it 
down to the 80186 and lower chips, otherwise it would compare to the 80286.}

286        ~ 68020 {hardware segmenting vs. 68020's 32-bit ALU and these chips 
come have no usable built-in MMU unlike their successors [80386, 68030].  The 
hardware segmenting's protected mode is used by OS/2 1.0 => and Windows 3.X. 
The use of the hardware segmenting and their 16-bit nature put the 286 between 
the 60000 and 68030 in features and the LC's 16-bit data path strenghthens the 
286 ~ 68020 comparison.}

386       ~ 68030 {Two 32-bit chips with MMUs, and protected memory.  A/UX 3.0 
is at present the only Mac OS to use the 68030's protected memory feature for 
apps.  System 7.x uses this feature to protect a RAM disk created by the 
Memory control panel but this is supported only on Powerbooks and Quadras.  
The Color Classic and LCII 16-bit hardware data paths makes the 68030s in them 
comparative to 386sxs.}

486sx   ~ 68LC040 {same as 486 and 68040 without the FPU; used as a low cost 
solution for people who do not need the FPU.  Only with programs sensitive to  
PCLK & pipelining does the 68LC040 behave like 486dx2 - FPU or a '486dx2sx'.}

486     ~ 68040 {two 32-bit microprocessors with built-in FPU, MMU, 8K 
internal cache (which is implemented as two 4K caches in the 68040 and one in 
the 486).  Only with programs sensitive to PCLK & pipelining does the 68040 
behave like a 486dx2.}

Pentium   ~ 68060 {Both are planned to be superscalar but both have heat 
problems.  These chips may flounder against the cheaper (PC Week 3/08/93; 
4/12/93; PC Mag 4/27/93:110), earlier released (PC Week 12/7/92; MacWeek 
12/14/92; PC Week 2/08/93), less leat producing {160 degrees F for Pentium
(PC Mag 4/27/93:118)}, and partly ported to PowerPC chips.} 

PowerPC   = PowerPC {This CPU line is planned to run programs from DOS, 
Windows 3.x, OS/2 and Mac OS on top of PowerOpen-A/UX 4.0 [UNIX] and later 
Pink [Taligent OS] by using emulators or, if necessary, the OSes themselves in 
a 'shell' a.k. how SoftPC or OS/2 does DOS.}

Hardware 
{In an effort to remove the 'reconfiguring the system almost every time you 
add something' requirement for add-in cards, drivers, video, and operating 
systems in the IBM world, Intel, Microsoft and 12 other hardware and software 
developers are working out 'plug and play' standards (PC Week 03/08/93).}
Color Support/Display
 Mac: 30.24 MHz Pixel Clock standard.  All present Macs support the use of 
32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw 
allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y-
bit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y 
independently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63 
dpi [12" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including 
autosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz 
vertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser 
Aug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and 
IIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit 
color (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).  
To keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display 
capability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit 
color.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX 
will change this.
In addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one 
monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same 
thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree 
of overlap of the pictures.
VRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of 
 built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit
 color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. 
Sound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.  Stereo sound became 
 standard with the SE/30.

IBM:  Even though PCs have ROM BIOS definitions of how the operating system 
interacts with the video hardware (Nan Zou), the use of drivers bypassing 
BIOS, video hareware inconsitancies {see Super VGA below} and nonstanderzation
of clone BIOS have left resolution of video display hardware, OS and program 
interaction up to the OS and video hardware in question (Faisal Nameer 
Jawdat). In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a 
standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is 
actually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like 
Mac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes, 
especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present 
things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver 
and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS, 
and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with 
an IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 
486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 
and still have ALL the colors one started out with}.
Later IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster 
processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD 
ROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  
MDA: Monocrome Display Adapter
 original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.
CGA: Color Graphics Array
 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.
EGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array
 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions 
 could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.
VGA:  Video Graphics Array*
 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are 
 the most commonly used.  All modes have a 256K CLUT, from a 
 18 to 24-bit {IBM} or a 32-bit {Mac} color palette.  25.175 MHz Pixel Clock
 (Mel Martinez).  Monitors use analog input, incompatible with TTL signals
 from EGA/CGA etc. 
MCGA:  Multi-Color Graphics Array*
 subset of VGA that provides all the features of MDA & CGA, but lacks some EGA 
 and VGA modes, like VGA 640x480x16 (Dictionary of Computer Terms-DCT).  
 Common on the initial PS/1 implementation from IBM and some PS/2 Models.
SVGA:  Super VGA*
 This is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch 
 all' category for a group of video cards.  As such, with each manufacturer 
 using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating
 as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a 
 standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things
 are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution
 of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since 
 1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, 
 some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually 
 at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital 
 Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example], 
 some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting 
 factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were: 
 8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a 
 64K "window", etc.
Other non-SVGA standards: 
8514/a:
 IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions 
 like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations 
 from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do 
 not have interlacing. 
TMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some
 do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD.
XGA:  eXtended Graphics Array
 newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones 
 are coming out soon.  Emulates VGA, EGA, and CGA (DCT).  Max resolution at 
 1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes.
XGA-2
 Accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard VGA in
 Windows and OS/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area
 fills, masking and X/Y addressing. Has an intelligent way to detect and co-
 exist with other XGA-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the Mac may not be 
 far away.  Since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth 
 isn't fixed {IBM implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other 
 companies can have 24-bit color through IBM technical licenses}. Refresh 
 rates up to 75 Hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual 
 discomfort, and is VGA compatible. Up to 1280x1024 on OS/2.
*some monitor types usable by Mac-See Mac section above for specific details.

Expansion
Both Mac & IBM
SCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.
 Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus card 
 expansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  
 Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
 terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port 
 {A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at the 
 end.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. 
SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}
 and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software
 drivers.  "Fast SCSI-1" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode
 {see SCSI-2 for details}.
SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully
 SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast
 SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  
 hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are
 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and
 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can
 use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such
 is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called "fast SCSI-1". 
 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics
 but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a
 different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which
 makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.
Mac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though 
 Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager
 needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI
 interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast 
 asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2
 controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) 
 though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port 
 interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus 
 Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some
 Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard 
 and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.
IBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with 
 systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.
 Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers
 out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications
 which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.

Mac
Memory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin 
 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs
 could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity 
 feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx 
 used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new 
 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.
 The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every
 memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will
 not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.
 Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs 
 had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris 
 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that 
 allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same 
 size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting 
 in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).
Printers, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.
Monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. 
PDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE, 
 Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.  
 Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650: 
 4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with
 the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in 
 IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows 
 through put down.
NuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,
 and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:
 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and 
 Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a 
 Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet 
 to DMA.
NuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:
 ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7" instead of the 
 old 12".
QuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's 
 VLBus - "Architecture is identical to that of VLBus" (Byte 10/92:128).
 Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development.
CPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,  
 Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at 
 the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to 
 dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each 
 NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with 
 8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.

IBM
Memory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac-
like SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.

HD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: 
MFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited
